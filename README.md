# Online-Course-App-Project

This was the final project for the Building a Really Useful App with Bootstrap IBM/edX course. Since completing this course, I'm now able to:

- Describe what is a database and how to model data
- Compose SQL queries to insert, select, update, delete data in a database
- Understand Object Relational Model (ORM)
- Employ Django to develop database-powered applications
- Deploy your Django app on the cloud

Below is the content from the original repo for the project. The project files included in my repo include updated/completed components to meet the project submission requirements.

**General Notes**

An `onlinecourse` app has already been provided in this repo upon which you will be adding a new assesement feature.

- If you want to develop the final project on Theia hosted by [IBM Developer Skills Network](https://labs.cognitiveclass.ai/), you will need to create the same project structure on Theia workspace and save it everytime you close the browser
- Or you could develop the final project locally by setting up your own Python runtime and IDE
- Hints for the final project are left on source code files
- You may choose any cloud platform for deployment (default is IBM Cloud Foundry)
- Depends on your deployment, you may choose any SQL database Django supported such as SQLite3, PostgreSQL, and MySQL (default is SQLite3)

**ER Diagram**
For your reference, we have prepared the ER diagram design for the new assesement feature.
